# hello, world!

i'm taylor, silly, üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è trans (maybe.), british, and maker of infinite loops.

i like rust and typescript. currently learning systemverilog because i simply
cannot get enough of the pain. pain for the pain gods. my verilog code is public
[here](https://github.com/ttaylor-st/verilog-things).

## things
* [dotfiles]: my dotfiles managed with stow. i use sway, foot, waybar and zsh,
on gentoo btw (once again, pain for the pain gods).
* [meowsh]: a shell written in rust. incredibly incomplete, literally just a 
prompt.
* [markdown-parser]: a markdown parser written in rust. also incomplete, but
at least it's fast.
* you can find other things on my [github], [gitlab], and [codeberg].
